SEEDSMASH Bot configuration file:
Please fill properly/completely.

"Play-style" parameters shape the strategy you will get. Note that their effect is not 100% clear,
as the combined effect of our chosen parameters is not obvious.
To illustrate with an example, a bot with a default configuration is rewarded with:
> 1 point for killing, -1 point for dying,
> 0.005 point per percent dealt, -0.005 point per percent suffered,
> -0.0002 point every 3 frames
NOTE: those rewards and other play-style related rewards affect the rewards collected by your bot for training only.
This is different from the actual performance metrics of your bot: rank, winrate, rating... which only depend on
whether your bot wins or loses.

* Will later be added:
- details about the algorithm used for training,
- the model used for the policy.

[INPUT] reflexion = 50
  * (Play-style) Reflexion.
  | Valid range: [0, 100]
  | 
  | Your bot cares decreasingly less about rewards as we go further into the future.
  | Essentially defines how much your bot cares about future rewards.
  | With a value of 0, your bot cares about half the rewards it will get two seconds into the future. This will lead
  | to a bot only caring about instant rewards, such as smashing.
  | With a value of 100, it will be 20 seconds instead.
  | 
  | Note: Higher the value, harder and longer it is to learn.
  | 
  | For example:
  | - 40-60 is a generally a good range.
  | By default, this is set to 50.
  * 
[INPUT] agressivity = 50
  * (Play-style) Agressivity.
  | Valid range: [0, 100]
  | 
  | How much your bot prioritises damaging/killing over getting damaged/dying.
  | 
  | Ex:
  | A value of 50 leads to a bot equally caring about defense and attack.
  | A value of 100 leads to a bot that does not care about dying.
  | A value of 0 leads to a bot that does not care about killing/damaging its opponent.
  | 40-60 is a good range for agressivity
  | By default, this is set to 50.
  * 
[INPUT] winning_desire = 0
  * (Play-style) Winning desire.
  | 
  | Strength of the reward signal received by your bot when winning, on top of the reward received when your opponent 
  | loses its last stock.
  | 
  | A reasonable range for the signal is 0-10
  | By default, this is set to 0.
  * 
[INPUT] patience = 50
  * (Play-style) Patience.
  | Valid range: [0, 100]
  | 
  | By default, this is set to 50.
  | Every 3 frames, your bot receives a small penalty, that diminishes with patience.
  | 
  | With a low patience, your bot will try to finish the game more quickly.
  | NOTE: a timeout is always considered a draw, and not a win for the play which has more stocks and less percent.
  | 
  | By default, this is set to 50.
  * 
[INPUT] creativity = 50
  * (Play-style) Creativity.
  | Valid range: [0, 100]
  | 
  | Gives a small bonus to your bot when in action animations it rarely encounters, e.g., wall-jumping, the different Marth dancing blades.
  | This essentially gives some exploratory boost.
  | 
  | By default this is set to 0.
  * 
[INPUT] off_stage_plays = 0
  * (Play-style) Off-stage plays.
  | Valid range: [0, 100]
  | 
  | How much your bot likes being offstage
  | Boosts the positive rewards received when offstage,
  | 
  | By default this is set to 0.
  * 
[INPUT] combo_game = 0
  * (Play-style) Combo game.
  | Valid range: [0, 100]
  | 
  | How much your bot plays around combos.
  | Boosts exponentially the reward received for each consecutive hit of a combo.
  | This incentives your bot to go for combos, rather than hit and run. 
  | 
  | Note: depending on the mained character, this may work as intended, or not...
  | 
  | By default this is set to 0.
  * 
[INPUT] combo_breaker = 0
  * (Play-style) Combo breaker.
  | Valid range: [0, 100]
  | 
  | How much your bot avoids getting combo-ed.
