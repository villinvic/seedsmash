# Ranking

# Animation, looking for a matchup... player cards going from top to bottom/bottom to top very fast and slow down, then: VS! animation (show probability of winning)
# Do we show cards ? slightly weird, with date on it is strange
# instead show tags with stats... maybe better.

# Periodically show player cards somewhere
# along learning curve and other stuff

# show total number of IGT played (infer from sampled frames)
